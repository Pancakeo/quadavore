npm install -g grunt-cli

Next, run npm install from the web1991 folder.

Then:
grunt build
That should produce a "build/" folder, with everything compiled.
If you'd like to make changes, do:
grunt heh
Which adds a watcher and recompiles most files on-the-fly.

# Launching the server (express routes and http static serving)
Run npm install from web1991/server
Then, node wup.js
